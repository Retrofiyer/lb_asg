## üìñ About the Project

The project consists of creating an application that displays an HTML page, hosted in a GitHub repository and managed using GitHub Actions. AWS services such as EC2, Load Balancer, and Auto Scaling Group are integrated to efficiently manage and scale infrastructure.

The workflow includes two main branches:

1. QA Branch: Configured to deploy to two instances using a Load Balancer. Deployments are automatically triggered by GitHub Actions when you make a pull request.

2. Main branch: Configured to deploy to four instances, using an Auto Scaling Group to ensure scalability and high availability. Deployments are also automatically run through GitHub Actions when you make a pull request.
